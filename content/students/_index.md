## For Students
### Ways to Connect, Collaborate, and Contribute.
--- 
#### Project Opportunities

I'm inviting students from all years to join various projects listed on the [Research page](https://shantanu-sg-01.github.io/homepage/research/). These opportunities are great for building skills early on—especially if you're preparing for mini or major projects, or planning to take up long-term research. The idea is to grow together in both depth and confidence, and strengthen your future prospects along the way. If you're interested, please follow the application instructions provided on the Research page.

#### Office Hours & Meeting Policy

+ Quick chats: Feel free to walk into my office anytime during working hours if it's a brief query (under 10–15 minutes).

+ Longer discussions: Please book a slot on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/shantanu_as-mvjce/office-houre-in-person) at least 2 hours in advance. This helps me plan and ensures we can talk without being rushed.

#### Volunteer Opportunities

I'm looking for a few enthusiastic students to assist with academic activities related to computing and programming. If you're excited by tech and want to be part of something meaningful, reach out during office hours or email me.
