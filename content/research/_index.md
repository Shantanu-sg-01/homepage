## Upcoming Miniprojects - V semester

<p align="justify">The following mini-projects are planned for 5th semester students under the research group. Each project may be undertaken individually or in teams as specified. Below are the project titles, required background, and a brief description of the expected deliverables:</p>

<strong>1. UAV Configuration Selection Using Data-Driven Multi-Criteria Decision Making</strong>
* Team Size: 4 members.
* Background: AE, AS. 
* <p align="justify">This project will improve your knowledge of current state-of-the-art in the drone technology. The outcome will be useful in conceptual design of uav in student's academic projects and in industry. Fundamental knowledge of UAV system components, performance parameters and willingness to learn python is expected.</p>

**2. Integration of libTorch with OpenFOAM for Physics-Informed Deep Learning in Aerodynamics**
* Team Size: Up to 2 members
* Background: AE, AS.
* <p align="justify">This is a great opportunity to get started with machine learning and CFD. Students should be ready to learn C++ programming and carry a problem-solving attitude.</p>

**3. Shape Optimization of Airfoils Using Adjoint Methods**
* Team Size: Up to 2 members
* Background: AE, AS.
* <p align="justify">Students interested in industrial application of aerodynamics can pursue this project. It will help develop strong understanding of engineering design optimization and python programming.</p> 

**4. Development of CUDA-based Functional Programming Framework for Solving Large Sparse Linear Systems**
* Team Size: Up to 2 members
* Background: AE, AS, CS, Strong programming skills, and access to a CUDA-capable GPU (locally or via cloud).
* <p align="justify">Students who want to excel in programming and problem-solving can choose this project. The aim is to develop a GPU-accelerated framework using CUDA and functional programming (preferably Haskell) to solve large sparse systems of linear equations.</p>

**5. Design of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for Tensor Calculus with Applications in Deep Learning**
* Team Size: Up to 2 members
* Background: CS, CD, IS, strong programming skills, and familarity with tensor mathematics., 
* <p align="justify">Students interested in developing their own programming language and contributing in open-source projects should choose this project. The aim is to develop an embedded DSL, preferably in Haskell, that captures the core elements of tensor algebra and calculus</p>

**6. Design of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for Solving Linear Programming Problems in Engineering**
* Team Size: Up to 2 members
* Background: CS/CD/IS, strong programming skills, and familarity with linear algebra.
* <p align="justify">Students interested in developing their own programming language and contributing in open-source projects should choose this project. The project involves the design and implementation of a DSL (preferably embedded in Haskell) for formulating and solving linear programming problems using classical algorithms such as the Simplex method.</p>

#### NOTE
Please make note for the project #4, #5 and #6. 
<p align="justify">The final project should be hosted on a public open-source package repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Hackage). It must include well-structured documentation, an installation guide, and at least five beginner-friendly tutorials or usage examples to help new users get started.</p>

### Open Projects 

I welcome self-motivated students from any branch, year, or level of experience to bring their own project ideas for discussion. If you're passionate, curious and willing to learn, we can explore it together. Please read further to know my interests and expertise.

## Research Focus

I’m broadly interested in using mathematics and programming to solve problems in science and engineering. My current focus is on the use of functional programming — especially Haskell — for building tools and frameworks in scientific computing.

Applied mathematics shows up in almost every aerospace sub-domain. Final selection of application area for projects will be made after a short 1:1 discussion to ensure alignment of interests. That said, I am still sharing application areas I am planning to explore:

+ Design of satellite constellation missions with coverage planning
+ Conceptual design of aero-vehicles for planetary or space exploration
+ Scheduling problems for airline operations
+ Multiphysics modeling (ex - coupled heat transfer and structures)
+ Aircraft Design with special focus on electric-powered and hydrogen-powered aircrafts
+ Machine-learning for modeling fluid flows and structurs
+ Quantum computing for aerodynamics
+ Flight mechanics of airships

### Research Group Policies

Once you're in the group, you're part of an active, collaborative, and professional learning environment. We aim to grow together — as thinkers, researchers, and creators. Here's how we work:

<strong> *Research Training* </strong>

We conduct regular training and discussions to develop strong research skills.

<strong> *Collaborative Culture* </strong>

Collaboration is encouraged across projects. Peer discussions and constructive feedback are part of the weekly routine, to troubleshoot commonly faced problems.

<strong> *Weekly Check-ins / Sync-ups* </strong>

Everyone is expected to give brief weekly updates. These help track progress, unblock issues, and keep ideas flowing.

<strong> *Project Documentation* </strong>

Maintain a shared research log or notebook (markdown or overleaf) with clear records of objectives, decisions, and results.

<strong> *Version Control (Git)* </strong>

All code must be managed through GitHub (or similar), with clean commit history and meaningful documentation.

<strong> *Academic Integrity* </strong>

Plagiarism, code copying, or misrepresenting contributions is strictly prohibited. Always cite sources and give credit where it's due.

<strong> *Respect Deadlines* </strong>

We value each other’s time. Set realistic goals and communicate proactively if you're unable to meet them.

<strong> *Openness to Learning* </strong>

You are not expected to know everything. Asking questions, making mistakes, and learning from them is a core part of research.

<strong> *Mentorship & Peer Support* </strong>

Senior students are encouraged to mentor juniors. We grow faster when we teach each other.

<strong> *Code of Conduct* </strong>

Respect diverse perspectives, communicate kindly, and maintain a safe and inclusive environment for all.
