### Courses

<p align="justify">Details of the courses I teach (or plan to teach) will be available here.

In the upcoming odd semester, I will be teaching Fluid Mechanics (III sem) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (VII sem), in Aerospace department.

This site will serve as a companion to these courses â€” hosting lecture references, problem sheets, reading lists, and project guidelines. I also plan to share assignment rubrics, weekly highlights, and supplementary materials that can help students go beyond the classroom. Stay tuned!</p>
